# TimesheetManager
Timesheet manager is currently being build in Kotlin and TornadoFx. The goal is to create and store timesheets for different projects, and to export those timesheets to a spreadsheet.

This project is an exercise in Kotlin and TornadoFx. It is very much incomplete but *eventually* I'll get around to completing it.
